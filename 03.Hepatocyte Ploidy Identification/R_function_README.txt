"addPloidy" function  takes as input the dapi_dtb file generated by the previous nuclear_feature_cal.py script.
  The parameter "num" represents the DAPI area threshold value for distinguishing between mononuclear diploid and mononuclear tetraploid cells. 
  The output is a dataframe that can be directly used with the AddMetaData function in Seurat. 
  The "new_ploidy" parameter enables direct manipulation of the meta.data in an existing Seurat object (after ploidy segmentation) to perform reclassification of cell ploidy.
